# w205-caltrain-final
Final project group work (Vineeta, Landon, Evan)

Acme Gourmet Meals (AGM) is exploring new delivery options to expand to new customers in the Bay Area. There is interest in the options below:

 - Adding more pickup locations
 - Using public transportation to transport deliveries
 - Using delivery drones
 - Using delivery robots
 - A hybrid approach of any combination of these options
 
 By using the Berkley store as a hub and the Bay Area Rapid Transit System in addition to the other options above, we will look into the most effective way to expand and service the largest number of new customers.
 
 # Data Cleansing and Analysis
 3_1: Create and load data into SQL relational tables

 3_5: Use Geodesic distances to explore models of expanding deliveries using BART public transit
 bay_area_population_exploration: Create functions to identify new customers and their nearest stations 
 transit_code: Create interactive maps for exploration of new delivery options in the Bay Area's most populous areas
