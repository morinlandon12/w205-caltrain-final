Final project group work (Vineeta, Landon, Evan)

Acme Gourmet Meals (AGM) is exploring new delivery options to expand to new customers in the Bay Area. There is interest in the options below:

 - Adding more pickup locations
 - Using public transportation to transport deliveries
 - Using delivery drones
 - Using delivery robots
 - A hybrid approach of any combination of these options
 
 By using the Berkley store as a hub and the Bay Area Rapid Transit System in addition to the other options above, we will look into the most effective way to expand and service the largest number of new customers.
